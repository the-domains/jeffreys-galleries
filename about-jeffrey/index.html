After attending California Institute of the Arts photography program I went for many years without doing much more creative than just documenting my daughter's childhood. Just in the last couple of years I have rediscovered the joy that photography gives me and the elation I feel being surrounded by the joy and innocence of children. Being creative again and working with and being around so many kids has made me the happiest I have ever been. It has also brought my daughter and me closer together because she helps on shoots occasionally, and has taken an interest in the post-production side of photography.</p><p>I have lived in and around Los Angeles my entire life and currently work as a photography curator for a non-profit foundation in Santa Monica. Photography has always been a passion of mine and I am grateful that I make a living working with photos. My personal work is in a developmental phase. My technical skills are improving with each shoot but I am still working to make my final images match what I see in these amazing kids. I remember the feeling of childhood. The sense of wonder and curiosity when exposed to something new. The rush to grow up but also remembering the feeling of safety and comfort of when I was even younger. My daughter is at this age now, when she sees me playing with very small kids, she remembers what it was like being tossed around and yet knowing she was safe in my hands. A part of her wishes she could go back to those days and another part of her is anxious to grow up. Yet, over the years, whenever she is asked, she always says her current age is the best.</p><p>I have been fortunate to find great parents who allow their child and me to be creative together. Working with the same kids over a period of time we are able to develop a great working relationship and documenting their growth physically and psychologically is a very special experience that I treasure. We work together maybe every two months. Every time I see them, there is always something a little different, a little less baby fat in the face, maybe an inch or two taller. We are creating a document of their childhood that their parents and I treasure now, and that they will treasure for the rest of their lives. When others view these images I want them to be reminded of just the most innocent and precious moments of their own childhood. I also want every photograph to be a glimpse into the amazing character of the child they see pictured before them.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="16"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="17"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="18"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="19"><span data-reactid="20"><!-- react-empty: 21 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="22"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="23">About Jeffrey</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="26"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
